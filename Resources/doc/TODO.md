* Extend current solution support to latest versions of eZ Publish Platform 5.x and eZ Platform 6.x

* Extend dynamic platform detection to optionally (disabled by default) provide for user to switch platform of links to display (rare use case need)

* Add more development items on the agenda to the TODO file :)
